1/26: I've posted the (first-draft) solutions of HW1 in the Weekly Assignments.  Please let me know if you find any typos or errors; I will post corrected solutions (if necessary) later this week. 
1/20: Just a note: this is my first time teaching this course, and so I'm still gauging what it is everybody knows already.  If I ever something like "Of course you already know this" in class and you don't actually know it, please let me know, either during class or afterwards. 
1/15: Homework #1 is now posted in the Weekly Assignments.  Please complete your assignment on a separate sheet (or sheets) of paper, rather than trying to cram it all in on the assignment page itself. 
1/11: McIntyre refers to a [http://www.opensourcephysics.org/items/detail.cfm?ID=7011 SPINS] simulation of the Stern-Gerlach experiment; you can download it for yourself here.  It requires Java.
1/10: Here is a copy of the [McIntyre.pdf first four chapters] of McIntyre's <I>Quantum Mechanics: A Paradigms Approach</I>.  We will begin with this material, before moving onto Griffiths.
