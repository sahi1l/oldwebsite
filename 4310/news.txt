3/9: I am going to be out of town for three days at the end of the month: 3/30, 4/1, and 4/4.  Since we're a small class, I wonder if we could reschedule those three classes for Tuesday the 29th, Thursday the 31st, and Tuesday the 5th.  Please check your schedules for those dates and think about what times you might be available.  I apologize for this inconvenience, and if we can't find an alternative time, I'll think of something else (guest lecturer, video lectures, group assignment during class time, etc).
3/2: The grades for the exam are now available in the Grades tab.  If you didn't get your exam back today, I'll have it on Friday.
2/29: Exam 1 [Exam1S.pdf solutions] are now posted.  <B>(Update: they were supposed to end up on the Exams tab but I need to dig into the website code.  But this link should work.)</B>  Let me know if you have any questions about them.
2/23: I noticed an error on page 5 of the review outline; I forgot the absolute value signs in the uncertainty principle (again).  I'll write the correction on the board tomorrow before the exam.
2/22: I will accept HW5 through February 29th, as I (accidentally) put on the top of the assignment.
2/15: Exam 1 is scheduled for Wednesday, February 24th.  It will be open notes, and cover the three chapters in McIntyre.  I will post a review/topic outline shortly. 
2/12:  Here's the schedule of the sections of Griffiths you should have prepared for next week's classes: <ul><li>For Monday: 2.3 (harmonic oscillators) and 2.4 (free particle) <li>Wednesday: 2.4 (free particle) <li>Friday: 2.5  (delta-function potential)</ul> That doesn't mean we'll <i>cover</i> them on those days, but you should be prepared.
2/8: You may turn in HW3 on Wednesday without penalty.
2/8: Due to some bizarre technical glitch that I don't understand, the audio for Monday's class was not recorded.  My apologies for the inconvenience.
2/5: For Wednesday, please read sections 2.1 and 2.2 in Griffiths, and work through the derivation of the eigenstates of the infinite square well. 
2/5: I made an error in the notes about the uncertainty principle: there should be absolute value signs around the right-hand side, like this: ∆A∆B ≥ |(1/2i) <[A,B]>|. I've added a correction to the online notes. 
2/2: I just looked it up, and the uncertainty principle we mentioned in class is called the "Robertson uncertainty principle".  So thank you, Howard P. Robertson!
2/1: Sorry, no recording for Monday Week 4. :(
2/1: Starting now, homework will be due on Mondays instead of Fridays.
1/28: Here is a [BraKetReview.pdf summary] of the things we've talked about in the first two chapters of McIntyre.  It's a lot!  :)  Please look it over, and bring questions with you to Friday's class, so we can have a little review before we push on to Schrodinger's equation.
1/28: Also, I've updated the solutions to HW1 to include the answers to 2d and 2e.
1/26: I've posted the (first-draft) solutions of HW1 in the Weekly Assignments.  Please let me know if you find any typos or errors; I will post corrected solutions (if necessary) later this week. 
1/20: Just a note: this is my first time teaching this course, and so I'm still gauging what it is everybody knows already.  If I ever something like "Of course you already know this" in class and you don't actually know it, please let me know, either during class or afterwards. 
1/15: Homework #1 is now posted in the Weekly Assignments.  Please complete your assignment on a separate sheet (or sheets) of paper, rather than trying to cram it all in on the assignment page itself. 
1/11: McIntyre refers to a [http://www.opensourcephysics.org/items/detail.cfm?ID=7011 SPINS] simulation of the Stern-Gerlach experiment; you can download it for yourself here.  It requires Java.
1/10: Here is a copy of the [McIntyre.pdf first four chapters] of McIntyre's <I>Quantum Mechanics: A Paradigms Approach</I>.  We will begin with this material, before moving onto Griffiths.
1/5: Welcome to the class website!  Click the Syllabus button above to learn more about the class.
