<h3>University Policies</h3>
<div class="section permanent">
Policy Statement on Non-Discrimination on the basis of Disability
  (ADA): The University is an equal opportunity educational
  institution. Please read The Universityâ€™s <A HREF="https://www.utoledo.edu/policies/administration/diversity/pdfs/3364_50_03_Nondiscrimination_o.pdf">Policy Statement on Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability--Americans with Disability Act Compliance.</A>
</div>

<h3>Academic Accommodations</h3>
<div class="section permanent">
  The University of Toledo is committed to providing equal access to
  education for all students. If you have a documented disability or
  you believe you have a disability and would like information
  regarding academic accommodations/adjustments in this course please
  contact the <A HREF="http://www.utoledo.edu/offices/student-disability-services/">Student Disability Services Office</A>.
</div>

<h3 class="ongoing"><a name="Policies">Academic Policies and Course Expectations</a></h3>
<div class="section">
  <h4>Excused Absences</h4>
  The University permits students to make up work for the following reasons only:
<ul>
<li> personal emergencies (personal illness, illness of a dependent, or death in the family);
<li> religious observances that prevent the student from attending class;
<li> University-sponsored activities, approved by the appropriate University authority;
<li> government-required activities (such as jury duty or military service)
</ul>
The following conditions must also hold:
<ul>
<li> the student contacts the instructor <i>before the class begins</i>, unless this was demonstrably impossible, using one of the following mechanisms: written note, email, telephone, or IM.  When feasible, it is better to use two communication mechanisms, as the student is responsible for failed communications (e.g. wrong number, lost email, etc).  Note that telling me in person about an absence is <i>not</i> acceptable, as I am responsible for over a hundred students and can't easily keep track of you all.
<li> the instructor is provided with acceptable documentation (e.g., a note from a doctor in the case of illness, a note from a coach in case of an athletic event, a program from a funeral or religious event, etc).
</ul>
Quizzes missed due to excused absences will simply be excluded from the student's quiz average; nor will they count as one of the student's ``dropped'' quiz grades.  Missed exams may be made up in the testing center <i>or</i> with an oral exam, at the instructor's discretion.  Homework will be accepted late without penalty in these circumstances, with a revised due date determined by the instructor (with student input).
<h4>Distractions:</h4> Mobile phones and other noisemakers must be silenced during lecture; violators will be mocked.  If you must take or make a phone call, please retire to the hallway to do so.  You may not use a cell phone for any reason during exams (including as a calculator).  If you <i>must</i> eat, play games, or engage in any other behavior which is mildly distracting to your fellow students or the instructor, please sit in the back of the classroom.  The instructor will ask you to stop or leave if you are too distracting.  If {\bf you} find another student's behavior to be distracting, and don't want to confront her or him yourself,  please let the instructor know.</li>
  <!--(Insert specific academic policies the student is expected to comply with; policies may include student conduct, academic dishonesty, missed class policy, student grievances, etc.)-->
  <!--(Insert a clear explanation of any and all course expectations -->
<!--you have. For example, parameters on class start times -->
<!--(tardiness); are late assignments accepted and if so under what -->
<!--circumstances, will late assignments be given full credit, is -->
<!--there extra credit, participation and attendance expectations, -->
<!--etc.)-->
<h4>Tardiness:</h4>
If you are <i>late</i> for an exam, come anyway; I might be able to
accommodate you, provided that you arrive before the end of the exam
period.
<h4>Withdrawal:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The deadline to <b>drop</b> this course is <u>January 25th</u>.
  (It will not show up on your transcript in that case.)
  <li>You may <b>withdraw</b> from this course at any time before
  <u>March 25th</u>. (The class will be listed on your transcript with
  a grade of W.)
</ul>
Both are done by the student through the Registrar; the instructor cannot drop or withdraw students (although he would appreciate being notified of the withdrawal).  Incompletes are only given in rare circumstances.
<h4>Extra Credit:</h4> The only extra credit available in class is the
occasional extra credit problem on an exam or homework set.  I do not
accept extra credit projects, papers, etc.  (However, there is plenty
of normal credit available in class.)
<h4>Talk to me!</h4> If you run into difficulty with the material, if an unexpected emergency comes up which makes it hard to come to class or complete assignments, if you don't like the way I'm teaching: please tell me.  I will do all that I can to help, within the framework of fairness to your fellow students.  Generally speaking, {\bf the earlier I know about a problem, the more I can do to help.

<h3 class="ongoing"><a name="Grading">Grading</a></h3>
<div class="section">
<ul>
  <li><h4>Participation (20%)</h4>
  This class will depend very much on your participation, and you will
  be graded appropriately.  In most weeks, you will be asked to work through a set of derivations from the textbook and be prepared to present them in class (because watching <i>me</i> do it would be both boring and unhelpful).  You will be given a grade each week depending on your preparation, which will be posted on the website.
  <li><h4>Homework (20%)</h4>
  Weekly homework will be posted on <b>Fridays</b> on the class website, and collected the following Friday in class (unless otherwise specified).  Homework is due by the end of class for full credit; late homework will be accepted through the following class for half credit <i>unless prior arrangements are made.</i> (It never hurts to ask.)  The two lowest homework grades will be dropped.  Depending on my whim that week, I might grade all problems in complete detail, or I might grade one or two problems at random, or I might give you credit for completing the work.
  <li><h4>Midterms (2 &times; 20%)</h4>
    Two midterms will be given in class.  They are closed-book and
  closed-notes, but students are permitted two sheets of paper, on
  which they may write or print or type or draw anything they choose,
  front and back.  Calculators are permitted (nay, required).  The
  exact dates are to be determined, but the first exam will occur
  sometime <b>after February 22nd</b>, and the second will be <b>April
  4th</b>.  Midterms dates are flexible, and I am happy to consider
  requests (e.g. to avoid a big exam or project in another class).

<li><h4>Final Exam (20%):</h4> The two-hour final exam will be held on <b>Monday, May 6th</b> from 12:30-2:30,
    in MH2002.  The final exam will be <i>open book</i> and <i>open
    notes</i>, and will be comprehensive, with an emphasis on the
    material not covered on the previous two exams.
    <li><h4>Honors</h4> If you are enrolled in the "honors section" of this class (section 091), there will be a required project.  Details will be provided to you during the second or third week of class.

<h3 class="ongoing"><a name="Schedule">Course Schedule</a></h3>

<div class="section">
The precise scheduling of topics will depend on how quickly we cover the material.  Here is a general outline.
<ul>
<li>We will begin by discussing the Stern-Gerlach experiment and the spin states of a spin-1/2 particle, as an introduction into the formalism of quantum mechanics.  This will be out of McIntyre (on reserve), and will cover at least 2 weeks.
<li>A brief discussion of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Paradox and Bell's theorem, again out of McIntyre.
<li>Then we'll move into Griffiths, beginning with (Chapter 2) a discussion of the one-dimensional time-independent Schrodinger equation and its solutions for various potentials.  This will become a lot more mathematical, and instead of working through algebra in class myself (boring) I will be expecting you to work through the textbook derivations yourself and present them in class, where we can discuss them together.  This will be the regular pattern for the rest of the class.  The first exam will cover at <b>least</b> this much, I think.
<li>Then Chapter 4, where we'll solve Schrodinger's equation in three dimensions in spherical coordinates, with a focus on the hydrogen atom.
<li>In Chapter 5 we'll talk about identical particles, the periodic table, and solids.
<li>The rest of the class will be devoted to Chapters 6-11, which are various approximation methods for solving Schrodinger's equation, ending with scattering theory.  I anticipate getting through most or all of this material, but I can't be certain.
