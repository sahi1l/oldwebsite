2/22: I accidentally put a due date of "February 29th" on HW5, but I know that could have been a source of confusion, so I will accept HW5 through <B>Friday</B> (the 26th) for full credit.  If that is a problem, let me know. 
2/21: The review outline for Exam 1, and last year's exam, is in the Exams tab above.
2/17: Exam 1 will be on <b>Monday, Februrary 29th</b> in class.  It will cover chapters 1 and 2, and a part of chapter 3; I will post a review/topic outline soon which will clarify what exactly to expect.  It is closed-book and closed-notes, but you can bring two sheets of notes, front and back.
#2/15: I'd like to propose that we have our first exam on <b>Monday, February 29th</b>, rather than next week.  Let me know if that sounds awful.  <s>The first exam will be either on Monday, February 22nd or Wednesday, February 24th.  (Sounds like there might be a big quantum exam on Monday.)  I'll let you know soon.</s>
2/10: Here is a [Hypersphere.pdf derivation] for the surface area of an n-dimensional sphere.
2/5: Ugh, the recording stopped on me again, so no audio for Friday Week 4.  I don't know if it's a software bug or I'm accidentally hitting the space bar or something.  I've downloaded a newer version of Audacity, or I might switch to a different program altogether for recordings.
2/2: Homework 3 is now posted.  Sorry for not getting it up last night.
1/30: You may have noticed I've moved the Grades into their own tab.  You can now enter your grade code in there, and see your grade on the first quiz.  Please let me know if you have any problems.
1/15: Due to a technical glitch, the audio from Friday's class (Week 1) is not available.  My apologies. 
1/9: Here is a [Diffusion/index.html diffusion] demo we saw in class.
