4/28: Here is an [Exam3Outline.pdf outline] of the new material (Chapters 6-8) you can expect to see on the final exam.  The exam will be roughly half new material, half material from Chapters 1-5.

4/7: There was an error in the solution of HW8, problem 2e: I said there were 3 microstates with E=0.01eV instead of two.  The version online has been corrected and is labelled "version 2.0"
4/7: There is no HW10 this week, so you can prepare for the exam.  I will post a new assignment on Monday, due the following Monday.
4/6: Exam 2 will be on Wednesday, April 13th.  It will cover Chapters 3-5.
4/1: Here is the [http://youtu.be/Xtm0xCICZEg second of two videos] for chapter 4, talking about refrigerators (and a little bit of heat engines at the beginning.)  The notes from these two videos can be found under Wednesday and Friday Week 11, in the Assignments tab.
3/29: The first of two videos for Chapter 4 can be found [http://youtu.be/cINmP5NZ1E8 here].  It discusses PV diagrams and heat engines.  A second, shorter video on refrigerators will be posted by Friday.
3/28: We will have Exam 2 in the second week of April (11th, 13th, or 15th).  It will cover Chapters 3, 4 (including PV diagrams), and 5.  If there is a day of that week that you <b>don't</b> want the exam to be (due to other exams, projects, etc), please email me before April 6th which is when I will announce the date of the exam.
3/25: We will not have class on Wednesday (3/30), Friday (4/1), or the following Monday. I will not have office hours on the days we don't have class, but I will add office hours on the next two Tuesdays at 10am.  There will be a video lecture covering Chapter 4 and PV diagrams, posted by next Wednesday; please watch it and take notes as you normally would as you will be responsible for the material.
3/17: Reminder: the syllabus says that quizzes are on material covered since the <I>previous quiz</I>.  That means that tomorrow's quiz can include material from the week before Spring Break as well as this week.

2/26: I'm posting the solutions to problems 1-3 for HW5, because those are most relevant to the exam on Monday.  I will get the remaining solutions done soon.
2/22: I accidentally put a due date of "February 29th" on HW5, but I know that could have been a source of confusion, so I will accept HW5 through <B>Friday</B> (the 26th) for full credit.  If that is a problem, let me know. 
2/21: The review outline for Exam 1, and last year's exam, is in the Exams tab above.

#2/15: I'd like to propose that we have our first exam on <b>Monday, February 29th</b>, rather than next week.  Let me know if that sounds awful.  <s>The first exam will be either on Monday, February 22nd or Wednesday, February 24th.  (Sounds like there might be a big quantum exam on Monday.)  I'll let you know soon.</s>
2/10: Here is a [Hypersphere.pdf derivation] for the surface area of an n-dimensional sphere.
2/5: Ugh, the recording stopped on me again, so no audio for Friday Week 4.  I don't know if it's a software bug or I'm accidentally hitting the space bar or something.  I've downloaded a newer version of Audacity, or I might switch to a different program altogether for recordings.
2/2: Homework 3 is now posted.  Sorry for not getting it up last night.
1/30: You may have noticed I've moved the Grades into their own tab.  You can now enter your grade code in there, and see your grade on the first quiz.  Please let me know if you have any problems.
