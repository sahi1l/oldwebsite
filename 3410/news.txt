2/10: Here is a [Hypersphere.pdf derivation] for the surface area of an n-dimensional sphere.
2/5: Ugh, the recording stopped on me again, so no audio for Friday Week 4.  I don't know if it's a software bug or I'm accidentally hitting the space bar or something.  I've downloaded a newer version of Audacity, or I might switch to a different program altogether for recordings.
2/2: Homework 3 is now posted.  Sorry for not getting it up last night.
1/30: You may have noticed I've moved the Grades into their own tab.  You can now enter your grade code in there, and see your grade on the first quiz.  Please let me know if you have any problems.
1/15: Due to a technical glitch, the audio from Friday's class (Week 1) is not available.  My apologies. 
1/9: Here is a [Diffusion/index.html diffusion] demo we saw in class.
